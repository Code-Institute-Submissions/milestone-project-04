## An introduction to the project

The 'WANT THAT' app will allow fashion-following online shoppers to compile lists of items from various online stores. It will be geared towards people who shop with multiple online retailers, like the online ‘window’ shoppers who browse their favourite brands’ websites to see what new items they might have released, see something they like but aren’t in a rush to purchase (and may be waiting until payday). Or the smart-shoppers who make informed decisions by browsing and comparing multiple retailers’ websites in the search for something specific, then need somewhere to store everything they find (instead of having hundreds of tabs open). The 'WANT THAT' app will make it easy for users to remember items they had discovered earlier and just as easy to jump to the retailers website to click buy. 

The user will be able to create a new list, such as a list for a birthday present or new items for a summer wardrobe. The user can then add items to the list, with information such as the brand name, price, link and image for easy reference. When reviewing items in the list, the user will also be able to easily click through to the online retailer in order to make their purchase. The items in the list will be easily edited
