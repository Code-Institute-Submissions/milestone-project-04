# WANT that

## An introduction to the project

The 'WANT THAT' app will allow fashion-following online shoppers to compile lists of items from various online stores. It will be geared towards people who shop with multiple online retailers, like the online ‘window’ shoppers who browse their favourite brands’ websites to see what new items they might have released, see something they like but aren’t in a rush to purchase (and may be waiting until payday). Or the smart-shoppers who make informed decisions by browsing and comparing multiple retailers’ websites in the search for something specific, then need somewhere to store everything they find (instead of having hundreds of tabs open). The 'WANT THAT' app will make it easy for users to remember items they had discovered earlier and just as easy to jump to the retailers website to click buy. 

The user will be able to create a new list, such as a list for a birthday present or new items for a summer wardrobe. The user can then add items to the list, with information such as the brand name, price, link to the product, a short description and an image for ease of reference. When reviewing items in the list, the user will also be able to easily click through to the online retailer in order to make their purchase. The items in the user's list can be edited easily and if the user is no longer interested in the item or has already purhcased it, they can easily delete the item from the list. 

When inputting information about an item into the site, the user will also be asked how much they need an item with the aim of deterring unnecessary spending, thinking about their finances and also to minimise the environmental impact.

## UX

### Site Users - who is the site focused on?
1. Gemma, “I have to go to a wedding in August and need a new outfit. I’m not particularly brand loyal and have been browsing lots of different websites trying to find something. I’ve seen lots of things but can’t keep track of everything! I need to start a list of all the things I’ve seen on WANT THAT so I can easily pick something when I'm ready”
2. Phil, “Work has been quiet so I’m spending a lot of time browsing online. I’m not going to have as much money this month as I normally do, so will wait until next payday to treat myself. I have a few favourite brands and want to collate all their releases in one place so when I’ve got money in the bank, I know what I’m going to buy!”
3. Jessica, “I’ve been making a list of jackets that I like on WANT THAT but saw someone wearing one of them and it looked hideous. I need to take it off my list”
4. Annika, “I love online shopping because I hate going into actual shops nowadays. I was building a list of things on WANT THAT for my boyfriend’s birthday and have now bought him something. I need to get rid of the birthday list”
5. Max, "I have a lot of free time and spend a lot of time browsing the web. I'm very image conscious and like to keep up to date with fashion and brands and use WANT THAT to collate all the things I've seen. When I'm ready to buy something, I'll check my list and go to the retailer's site. I used to forget what I wanted before!"

### 'WANT THAT' is the best place for users to achieve their goals because:
- The site is easy to navigate with clear steps for navigating through the site
- The site's styling aids accessibility, with light backgrounds, dark text and minimal clutter
- It provides users with a solution to group items that have caught their attention
- The site will allow users to edit and delete lists, as well as editing and deleting the items contained within the lists
- The site allows users to easily reference items, navigating through lists and with visual references from images and user generated descriptions
- It offers an easy journey from the site to the retailer when the user is ready to make a purhcase
